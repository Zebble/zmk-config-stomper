# ZMK config for a "Stomper" peddle and wireless dongle.

The motivation behind this project was to enable using a peddle for melee (default key is "f") in Halo Infinite on an XBox Series X.  I seemed to always hit Melee by mistake if it was on the movement stick!

Latency seems good.

Hardware used:

2 x Tenstar Robot NRF52840 boards: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008099273300.html<br/>
1 x 301230 LiPo battery:  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32732458079.html<br/>
1 x Momentary Contact Pedal:  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006697183685.html<br/>
1 x SPDT micro switch:  https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07BMPVDMD<br/>
Various wires and 1 USB-C to USB-A cable to connect to the XBox.

I've created a 3D-printed enclosure that snaps under the pedal with the pedal's feet removed.
STL included in the "CAD" folder.

I then added stick-on rubber feet to the bottom.
